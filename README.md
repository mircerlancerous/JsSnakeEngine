# JsSnakeEngine
A Battlesnake engine which runs in your web browser

Battlesnake is a fun way to try out your API development skills, and put your stategic coding to the test against other developers. Check out Battlesnake at https://dev.offthebricks.com/Battlesnake/api/v1

The live Battlesnake engine does not provide many opportunities for testing your snakes, and measuring response times. This javascript version allows you to use the browser's dev tools to view API response times, and step your snake through the game one step at a time.

In addition to having more control of the way each Battlesnake game plays out, this engine also allows for the loading of custom scenarios. Custom scenarios include building mazes out of large unmoving snakes, or changing the victory conditions to eating food instead of last snake alive.

Usage is very simple: just load the file in your browser, tell it where to find your snake, and you're off.

Be warned that this was whipped together pretty quick, so it's not polished but it works!
